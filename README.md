# ipi-ecs
# IPI Experiment Control System

A modular control system architecture featuring a compact DDS system with push-subscribe KV data and event distribution, dynamic subsystem registry, a network-based continuous journal-like logging system with archival and database-based querying, data recording and replay services, TUI or tk based UI, lifecycle management, reflection, and more.

Designed to fit but not be specifically tailored to the requirements for our in-house EUV source control system, with modularity and fault tolerance in mind, ipi-ecs can suit applications ranging from research systems to electric vehicle firmware (yes, really!).
